# Time dilation

This project aims to test a hypothesis through the creation of a simulation. The hypothesis is that the passage of time in a moving object appears 
differently to a stationary object depending on whether the moving object is approaching or receding from the stationary one. The animation is 
available [here](https://github.com/Kiril-Lazarov/Moving-bodies/blob/main/Time%20Dilation/Time%20Dilation.mp4) in MP4 format.

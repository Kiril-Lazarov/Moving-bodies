On the other hand, the gamma factor is a RATIO between\\ntwo quantities, and from a purely logical standpoint, to have a ratio between two quantities... there must be\\ntwo quantities. :)))\\nGiven this situation, the only possibility left is to measure it from outside. However, if the simulation shown\\nis correct, this possibility is also ruled out. This leads to the next question.\\n\\nQuestion 2\\n\\nIf it is not possible to observe the gamma factor empirically, then why do we believe it exists? The answer is - because the readings of the receiver in this simulation are such precisely because the gamma factor for motion at 85 percent of the speed of light is exactly that - 0.52... Thus, it can be calculated based on these readings and the equations for relativistic effects from the Special Theory of Relativity.
